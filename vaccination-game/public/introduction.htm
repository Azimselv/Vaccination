      The following questionnaire is part of a student research project hoping to contribute
      to the research on vaccination. This means that the data provided by you will be handled
      with confidentiality and not be used outside of scientific purposes. You can opt out of
      answering questions, nonethless, if you do not want to answer them.
      <br><br>
      The questionnaire is expected to take around 10 minutes to complete. You will be asked for
      some demographic information and general opinions. The main part consists of your rating of
      a scenario. Please make sure that you read the scenario closely. We also kindly ask you to
      explain your reasoning briefly.
      <br><br>
      Again, thank you for your participation!
