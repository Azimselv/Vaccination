      The next part of the questionnaire requires you to understand some terms.
      Though you may already be familiar with it, we explain a few important terms here and
      ask you to read them carefully.
      <br><br>
      Infection Rate: The infection rate tells you how many people an infected person infects
      on average. E.g., an infection rate of 2 would mean that every infected person infects
      2 other people on average.
      <br><br>
      Death Rate: The death rate tells you how large the percentage of people is who have the
      disease and then die of it. E.g., a death rate of 5% would mean that 5% of those having
      the disease die.
      <br><br>
      Vaccinated Population Rate: This number tells you the percentage of the population which
      has already received a vaccination against the specific disease. E.g., a vaccination rate
      of 90% would mean that 90% of the population are vaccinated.
