### Research Question 
Does the percentage of the population already vaccinated and the infection rate of a virus influence people regarding their decision towards vaccination?

### Introduction and Theory

The Covid-pandemic and the vaccine to overcome it are on everyone's mind. Though the news of successful vaccine trials and its subsequent admission in the United States and then in the European Union were celebrated, a quite substantial percentage of the population seems to feel wary regarding the decision to get vaccinated themselves with the Süddeutsche Zeitung even dubbing it „Die Vertrauensfrage“, i.e., „The question of trust“ (Becker 2020, Charisius 2020).  The question is, how willing people are to get vaccinated with a vaccine with limited long-term experience. Even people who are generally advocating vaccination seem uncertain regarding this specific situation (Becker 2020). 

 Previous vaccination research often assumes free-riding - when many people have been vaccinated already, a person does not have to get vaccinated him-/herself and will, nonetheless, be protected (Ibuka et al. 2014). However, the theory of free-riding is usually employed in cases where a large percentage of the population is vaccinated and has been for a while. Nonetheless, some people currently argue in a similar manner when saying that they will wait for others to be vaccinated first (Charisius 2020). Their reason for this decision is not explicitly to wait until it is no longer necessary for them to receive the vaccine - though implicitly they do assume that the current crisis gets resolved if others get vaccinated - but rather to be certain that there are no negative consequences of receiving it. This, we argue, is another form of free-riding at play, though, not the one traditionally researched.

Other scholars showed and argued for more complex processes relating to the decision in favor of  receiving a vaccine (Streefland et al.1999, Streefland 2001). For example, people are influenced by other people  in their social circle and are more likely to get vaccinated when they do (bandwagon effect). They are also more likely to get vaccinated if they are educated both on the disease’s risks as well as on the vaccine. Again, the current situation only allows the latter in a limited manner and thus makes it very different from anything previously studied. The former, however, is probably very much given currently. Connected to this, an important aspect is the perceived risk for oneself and others and with the a new and potentially even more infectious Covid-variant discovered (Zeit 2020), people should be more willing to receive the vaccine, if this theory holds true.

Thus, given the previous research results and the current ever-changing, new situation, we ask the following question: Does the percentage of the population already vaccinated and the infection rate of a virus influence people regarding their decision towards vaccination?

As infection rate we define the number of people an infected person infects on average. The easier a disease spreads, the higher the risk of being affected by it oneself (and by spreading it to others). 


### Hypotheses

Given the two kinds of free-riding introduced earlier, we argue that people are at first waiting for other people’s experiences with the vaccine before getting vaccinated themselves and that when many have been vaccinated already, they again do not vaccinate because of the traditional free-riding phenomenon. Thus, our first hypothesis is:

H1: If the percentage of the vaccinated population increases up to a certain point, more individuals decide in favor of vaccination. From then on, the relationship turns negative (i.e. the more people are vaccinated, the fewer individuals decide in favor of vaccination).

Furthermore, in accordance with Streefland (2001) we assume that an increased risk awareness drives people towards vaccination, thus:

H2: If the infection rate is high, more people will get vaccinated.

We also believe, the two aspects - infection rate and populated vaccination percentage - interact, i.e., we argue that the negative effect of a high percentage of people already vaccinated is even more pronounced when the perceived risk is low. Therefore:

H3: If the percentage of vaccinated population is high and the infection rate is low, less people will decide in favor of vaccination.

To test the above hypotheses, we will conduct a vignette online experiment varying the two independent variables.


### Experiment

##### Variables and Treatment

Thus, the dependent variable will be a dummy variable that shows whether a person says that he/she would get vaccinated or not. The independent variables will be the infection rate and the percentage of the population which is already vaccinated. There are X different conditions of the infection rate (…), and Y different conditions for the percentage of the population already vaccinated (…). The respondents will always receive a combination of the two treatment variables. 

Furthermore, we will control for certain aspects. Among our control variables are measures for how involved people are in the lives of family members and whether they spend time volunteering. We assume that both of these variables will increase people’s willingness to get vaccinated either to protect others (family) or because of a sense of community duty (volunteering). We also tentatively ask about their medical history. Regularly going to the doctor or having a chronic disease should increase people’s willingness to vaccinate. As this is a very sensitive topic we only ask for this information by asking: ABC.

Additionally, we ask for respondent’s trust in the government and large companies. We believe that people distrustful to those entities generally are less likely to trust a new vaccine admitted by those entities. 

As is norm, we ask for a number of demographic information (such as age, gender, etc.). Two of the variables we are especially interested in regarding this are the respondent’s level of eduction and income as in particular the first one is often assumed to be important. The latter one is asked by giving people categories to choose from where they can say where they would place themselves regarding their income in relation to that of others in their country. This is done in that manner, because this is also a traditionally sensitive topic and because we aim to ask people in many different countries making a comparison otherwise difficult.

##### Survey Construction

As already mentioned, we decided to test out hypothesis using a vignette experiment. The questionnaire is split up in X parts. After a general introduction to the survey, we ask respondents for some general socio-demographic information. Then, we explain important terms to them and test their understanding to make sure that the respondents will give informed answers. Afterwards, we explain the specific scenario to them and, again, check their understanding. They will then be given an infection rate and a percentage of the population vaccinated and asked to answer, whether they would get vaccinated. They will be given new combinations Y times and will be asked for their decision every time. We decided to give them multiple treatments so that we do not have as high requirements relating to the number of people necessary to participate to get results and because we think that every potential effect of receiving one kind of treatment first and then the next will average out. We decided against using more than Y treatments so that people do not get bored. After they have completed this part, they will be asked why they decided the way they did, before some more control variables will be covered.
