#### Research Question 
Does the percentage of the population already vaccinated and the infection rate of a virus influence people regarding their decision towards vaccination?

#### Introduction and Theory

The Covid-pandemic and the vaccine to overcome it are on everyone's mind. Though the news of successful vaccine trials and its subsequent admission in the United States and then in the European Union were celebrated, a quite substantial percentage of the population seems to feel wary regarding the decision to get vaccinated themselves with the Süddeutsche Zeitung even dubbing it „Die Vertrauensfrage“, i.e., „The question of trust“ (Becker 2020, Charisius 2020).  The question is, how willing people are to get vaccinated with a vaccine with limited long-term experience. Even people who are generally advocating vaccination seem uncertain regarding this specific situation (Becker 2020). 

 Previous vaccination research often assumes free-riding - when many people have been vaccinated already, a person does not have to get vaccinated him-/herself and will, nonetheless, be protected (Ibuka et al. 2014). However, the theory of free-riding is usually employed in cases where a large percentage of the population is vaccinated and has been for a while. Nonetheless, some people currently argue in a similar manner when saying that they will wait for others to be vaccinated first (Charisius 2020). Their reason for this decision is not explicitly to wait until it is no longer necessary for them to receive the vaccine - though implicitly they do assume that the current crisis gets resolved if others get vaccinated - but rather to be certain that there are no negative consequences of receiving it. This, we argue, is another form of free-riding at play, though, not the one traditionally researched.

Other scholars showed and argued for more complex processes relating to the decision in favor of  receiving a vaccine (Streefland et al.1999, Streefland 2001). For example, people are influenced by other people  in their social circle and are more likely to get vaccinated when they do (bandwagon effect). They are also more likely to get vaccinated if they are educated both on the disease’s risks as well as on the vaccine. Again, the current situation only allows the latter in a limited manner and thus makes it very different from anything previously studied. The former, however, is probably very much given currently. Connected to this, an important aspect is the perceived risk for oneself and others and with the a new and potentially even more infectious Covid-variant discovered (Zeit 2020), people should be more willing to receive the vaccine, if this theory holds true.

Thus, given the previous research results and the current ever-changing, new situation, we ask the following question: Does the percentage of the population already vaccinated and the infection rate of a virus influence people regarding their decision towards vaccination?

As infection rate we define the number of people an infected person infects on average. The easier a disease spreads, the higher the risk of being affected by it oneself (and by spreading it to others). 


#### Hypotheses

Given the two kinds of free-riding introduced earlier, we argue that people are at first waiting for other people’s experiences with the vaccine before getting vaccinated themselves and that when many have been vaccinated already, they again do not vaccinate because of the traditional free-riding phenomenon. Thus, our first hypothesis is:

H1: If the percentage of the vaccinated population increases up to a certain point, more individuals decide in favor of vaccination. From then on, the relationship turns negative (i.e. the more people are vaccinated, the fewer individuals decide in favor of vaccination).

Furthermore, in accordance with Streefland (2001) we assume that an increased risk awareness drives people towards vaccination, thus:

H2: If the infection rate is high, more people will get vaccinated.

We also believe, the two aspects - infection rate and populated vaccination percentage - interact, i.e., we argue that the negative effect of a high percentage of people already vaccinated is even more pronounced when the perceived risk is low. Therefore:

H3: If the percentage of vaccinated population is high and the infection rate is low, less people will decide in favor of vaccination.

To test the above hypotheses, we will conduct a vignette online experiment varying the two independent variables.
