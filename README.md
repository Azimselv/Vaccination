#### Research Question: 
Does the percentage of the population already vaccinated and the infection rate of a virus influence people regarding their decision towards vaccination?

#### Importance:
The Covid-pandemic and the hope for a vaccine are on everyone's mind. The question is, how willing people are to get vaccinated with a vaccine that no one has real experience with. Previous research often assumes free-riding- (when many people are vaccinated, individuals decide against vaccination) or bandwagon- (when people in their social circle are vaccinated, individuals get vaccinated) effects. However, little research has been done on what happens, if there simply are no already vaccinated people. This is an interesting and relevant question, however, that we attempt to tackle. Furthermore, we are interested, if people's willingness to get vaccinated is affected by the infection rate and how this interacts with the vaccinated peopulation.

#### Terminology:
*Percentage of the population vaccinated*: The percentage of the population that has already decided in favor of getting the vaccine. The population is everyone in the country.

*Infection Rate*: Number of people an infected person infects on average.

#### Hypotheses:
H1: If the percentage of the vaccinated population increases up to a certain point, more individuals decide in favor of vaccination. From then on, the relationship turns negative (i.e. the more people are vaccinated, the fewer individuals decide in favor of vaccination).

H2: If the infection rate is high, more people will get vaccinated.

H3a: If the percentage of vaccinated people is high and the infection rate is low, less people will decide in favor of vaccination.

H3b: If the percentage of vaccinated people is low and infection is high, more people will decide in favor of vaccination.

#### Approach:
- create an online survey in which people will be asked for some demographic details
- every participant is given the same scenario of a virus disease with certain symptoms etc.
- but we vary the disease's infection rate (preliminary values: 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 20) and the percentage of the already vaccinated population (preliminary values: 5%, 23%, 51%, 72%, 95%)
- and ask particpants whether they would get vaccinated
- and why they decided as they did
